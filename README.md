# Intralism-Bot
A simple Intralism Bot made in late 2018. Ugly Code.

This got made in late 2018. I had fun making it. This Repo is supposed to give you a simple idea on how to approach this game when developing a bot for it. The game changed a lot since then. You will need to update it yourself.


# Features
While developing this Bot I reversed the Game itself a lot to determine their methods on finding cheaters.
Features I did included already:

- Humanizer / Randomizer
- Bypass of their listed Process gathering
- Map Detection
