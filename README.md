# Intralism-Bot
A simple Intralism Bot made in late 2018. Ugly Code.

This got made in late 2018. The game changed a lot since then. This Repo is supposed to give you a simple idea on how to approach this game when developing a bot for it. You will need to change the Offsets to make this work without changing everything else.


# Features
While developing this Bot I reversed the Game itself a lot to determine their methods on finding cheaters.
Features I did included already:

- Humanizer / Randomizer
- Bypass of their listed Process gathering
